<div class="poemtitle">THE PACIFIST</div>

<div class="i0">In Ben’s blood there coursed the fire of the Celt,</div>
<div class="i2">A strain of the strong Saxon thew;</div>
<div class="i0">From his eyes shot a glint of a son of the South&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">An American type through and through.</div>
<div class="i0">A dreamer, daredevil, and care free, they say,</div>
<div class="i2">Who lived in the far remote past,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">An unpractical man and careless forsooth;</div>
<div class="i2">Inclined as a youth to be fast.</div>
<div class="i0">He’d shot up the town and sowed some wild oats,</div>
<div class="i2">And once on a time rolled the dice,</div>
<div class="i0">But heart like an ox and muscled like steel;</div>
<div class="i2">A dreamer? Yes, without price.</div>
<div class="i0">He filled no great niche in the town where he lived,</div>
<div class="i2">Was never considered worth while.</div>
<div class="i0">The pacifist craft rolled their eyes to the sky</div>
<div class="i2">And mentioned his name with a smile,</div>
<div class="i0">An odious smile, twixt a smirk and a grin,</div>
<div class="i2">A smile that was snaky and sly.</div>
<div class="i0">They’d ne’er draw a sword nor strike with a club,</div>
<div class="i2">But could damn with the lift of an eye.</div>
<div class="i0">The tocsin of war sounds at last in the land,</div>
<div class="i2">And threatened invasion seemed near.</div>
<div class="i0">The hand of the patriot went to the sword;</div>
<div class="i2">The pacifist muttered in fear;</div>
<div class="i0">He muttered, then sold to the Government, ground</div>
<div class="i2">Down hard by the burden of Thor,</div>
<div class="i0">Life’s veriest needs at prohibitive rates;</div>
<div class="i2">Conscription did curse and abhor.</div>
<div class="i0">Ben rode to the front with the coming of strife</div>
<div class="i2">Where the roar of the guns rose and fell;</div>
<div class="i0">Was killed while he strove for democracy’s cause</div>
<div class="i2">As he fought like a demon of hell.</div>
<!--Pg_010-->
<div class="i0">They builded a shaft in the town of his birth</div>
<div class="i2">To the rascally skin and the beat</div>
<div class="i0">Who’d tricked Uncle Sam by short-changing of food,</div>
<div class="i2">A lynx-eyed and oily old cheat</div>
<div class="i0">Who yapped about honesty, horrors of war,</div>
<div class="i2">Contributed largely of speech</div>
<div class="i0">And words of advice to the youth thereabouts&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">His pacifist face was a ‘screech’,</div>
<div class="i0">Ben hadn’t a shaft where his forefathers slept</div>
<div class="i2">Nor niche in the Chancel of Fame;</div>
<div class="i0">No tablet recited the list of his deeds,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor blazoned the worth of his name.</div>
<div class="i0">He died as men do who answer the call</div>
<div class="i2">With boots on and pierced to the heart;</div>
<div class="i0">He died and those lived who, sneering at him,</div>
<div class="i2">Sucked the people’s blood dry in the mart;</div>
<div class="i0">Conniving at profit, a pacifist brood,</div>
<div class="i2">Not unwilling a country to sell;</div>
<div class="i0">Iniquitous, plotting and pandering to pelf&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">The opal-eyed vampires of hell!</div>

<div class="i0">Congestion releasing</div>

<div class="i2">He paused before speaking:</div>

<div class="i2">I’ve most choked to death, see?</div>
<div class="i0">The cause of the matter</div>
<div class="i2">Was eating your apple,</div>

<div class="i0">Some “Ad’s” sons have fatal</div>
<div class="i2">Big lumps all a bulging,</div>
<div class="i0">Their cervicals craning,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">’Twas “Grandfather’s” fault,</div>
<div class="i0">Heredity’s (s) training,</div>
<div class="i2">That lump in their throats just</div>

<div class="i0">There’s a quaint and care-free tavern</div>
<div class="i0">In the heart of business life,</div>
<div class="i0">In the Quaker City’s centre,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">Where relaxation’s rife.</div>
<div class="i0">’Tis a melting pot and leveler</div>
<div class="i0">For the man who has a ‘bump’,</div>
<div class="i0">Or the one with trouble burdened</div>
<div class="i0">Like a dromedary’s hump.</div>
<div class="i0">One finds parry and riposte rare</div>
<div class="i0">Unto the nth degree,</div>
<div class="i0">And Barney Bright, the Irish wight,</div>
<div class="i0">Who orders “darks” for me.</div>
<div class="i0">Here Andrew Jackson Johnson,</div>
<div class="i0">Or MacDee, with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir faire</i>,</div>
<div class="i0">Smooths down the foolish talker</div>
<div class="i0">Who wildly pounds the air.</div>
<div class="i0">Now diplomatic “Jack” and “Mac”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">MacDee, I mean&mdash;the two</div>
<div class="i0">Have often smoothed the ruffled path</div>
<div class="i0">For you and me and you.</div>
<div class="i0">Here rotund, pleasant Pickerel</div>
<div class="i0">Disports in ornate phrase,</div>
<div class="i0">And Henry Schaffer ‘Gungha Dins:’</div>
<div class="i0">Descants Bohemia’s ways</div>
<div class="i0">Or “Colonel Massa” Hallowell,</div>
<div class="i0">Of famed blue-grass renown,</div>
<div class="i0">Exploits the perfect luxury</div>
<div class="i0">Of bourbon trickling down.</div>
<div class="i0">And so, ad infinitum,</div>
<div class="i0">From out the clouds of smoke,</div>
<div class="i0">Away from tribulation,</div>
<div class="i0">We laugh and jest and joke.</div>
<div class="i0">Now far as I have wandered,</div>
<!--Pg_013-->
<div class="i0">At home, abroad, afar,</div>
<div class="i0">I’ve never seen the equal</div>
<div class="i0">Of Bill MacDee’s cigar.</div>
<div class="i0">Its shape just at the lighting</div>
<div class="i0">Is like Zeppelin’s air craft;</div>
<div class="i0">’Tis round and rolled so nicely</div>
<div class="i0">And pointed fore and aft;</div>
<div class="i0">It faithfully interprets,</div>
<div class="i0">In rising rings of smoke,</div>
<div class="i0">Each psychologic moment,</div>
<div class="i0">Each point and pass and poke.</div>
<div class="i0">Now when it’s smooth and rounded</div>
<div class="i0">Mac’s camping on the trail</div>
<div class="i0">Of something that’s been mooted,</div>
<div class="i0">And works his mental flail.</div>
<div class="i0">This cautious Scottish Quaker’s</div>
<div class="i0">“I see” means “I’ve a hunch”;</div>
<div class="i0">He’s sparring for an opening</div>
<div class="i0">Before he hands a punch,</div>
<div class="i0">But just before he counters</div>
<div class="i0">While listening to us “spar,”</div>
<div class="i0">You will never see the equal</div>
<div class="i0">Of good, old Mac’s cigar.</div>
<div class="i0">It’s whirled round like a cyclone;</div>
<div class="i0">It’s feathered like an owl;</div>
<div class="i0">It’s mussed up like a scrap can</div>
<div class="i0">Or poor-plucked barnyard fowl.</div>
<div class="i0">It’s frayed and furred and serrate;</div>
<div class="i0">It’s toothed and torn and spurred;</div>
<div class="i0">It’s ripped and ribbed and ragged,</div>
<div class="i0">And this is what’s occurred;</div>
<div class="i0">Chaotic conversation</div>
<div class="i0">A figure needs, you know,</div>
<div class="i0">A metaphor or something</div>
<div class="i0">Interpreting its flow;</div>
<div class="i0">To visualize its looseness,</div>

<div class="i0">Its academic “punk”</div>
<div class="i0">From Literary Digests;</div>
<div class="i0">Its casuistic “bunk.”</div>
<div class="i0">And so when I’m relaxing,</div>
<div class="i0">And talking wild and far,</div>
<div class="i0">I catch my real reflection</div>
<div class="i0">In Bill MacDee’s cigar.</div>
<div class="i0">I trust that it may “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fumer</i>,”</div>
<div class="i0">Frayed, frazzled old cheroot,</div>
<div class="i0">For many years of joy for Mac,</div>
<div class="i0">With other things to boot.</div>
<div class="i0">And when I’ve run my gamut</div>
<div class="i0">And am “crossing of the bar,”</div>

<div class="poemtitle">THE POOR MAN’S CLUB</div>

<div class="i0">The Poor Man’s Club is a wonderful place,</div>
<div class="i2">Neither fashionable, swift nor slow,</div>
<div class="i0">A kindly, rare, psychological spot,</div>
<div class="i2">As those who frequent it well know.</div>
<div class="i0">It’s built on the marvelous “Dutch treat” plan</div>
<div class="i2">Which is sane and destructive to fear.</div>
<div class="i0">You stand for yourself, also pay for yourself,</div>
<div class="i2">And expand in democracy’s cheer.</div>
<div class="i0">Now this old club, in fact, is just an excuse</div>
<div class="i2">For a rare metaphysical “bee.”</div>
<div class="i0">“Missourians” they, with a look which conveys:</div>
<div class="i2">“My friend, you will have to show me.”</div>
<div class="i0">No cynical scoff nor ironical thrust,</div>
<div class="i2">No skeptical look nor a sneer,</div>
<div class="i0">Just a leveling kind, “don’t throw a bluff” glance,</div>
<div class="i2">Then “welcome here without fear.”</div>
<div class="i0">The Poor Man’s Club hates the stuffed suit kind;</div>
<div class="i2">I opine it dislikes the “know</div>
<div class="i0">It all” sort, the artistically weird,</div>
<div class="i2">Still more it detests the blow.</div>
<div class="i0">It ignores the sycophant’s sly, smooth tricks</div>
<div class="i2">And the man who tries to droll.</div>
<div class="i0">It shunts a cold, climbing, cynical cad</div>
<div class="i2">As it would a plain damned fool.</div>
<div class="i0">In short it’s a sane sort of potpourri</div>
<div class="i2">Or a melting pot, you know,</div>
<div class="i0">For “high brow,” “low brow,” no brows at all,</div>
<div class="i2">Or flotsam who just come and go.</div>
<div class="i0">Yes, the Poor Man’s Club is a leveling place</div>
<div class="i2">For the man with mental bumps.</div>
<div class="i0">Its light and cheer are just the best boost</div>
<div class="i2">For the one who’s in the dumps.</div>
<div class="i0">Life’s edges rough with a deft, tactful touch,</div>
<div class="i2">It smooths for the man who’s down,</div>
<!--Pg_019-->
<div class="i0">And the one who’s up never tries the snide trick</div>
<div class="i2">Of a patronizing frown.</div>
<div class="i0">So if some night you are all out of sorts</div>
<div class="i2">And don’t know what to do,</div>
<div class="i0">Why just drop in to the Poor Man’s Club,</div>
<div class="i2">And let me present to you</div>
<div class="i0">First “Jack” and “Mac,” then old “Skeff” and “Lope”</div>
<div class="i2">And “Jawn” and rare “Doc” and “Bill,”</div>
<div class="i0">Also “Mont” and “Cook,” or some “also ran brows,”</div>
<div class="i2">And then you can have your fill</div>
<div class="i0">Of talk that’s light and a good heartening up</div>
<div class="i2">And kindly repartee,</div>
<div class="i0">In the night you spend in parry and tierce</div>
<div class="i2">At the sign of the “Old P. M. C.”</div>

<div class="i0">I shall ever recall, if I live to four score,</div>
<div class="i0">The impress she made on me, the old bore,</div>
<div class="i0">As she sat on the stairs one night long ago,</div>

<div class="i0">I’m sure that “Texas” Chenoweth is easily the star</div>
<div class="i0">Of all elusive “quarters” who ever tried to squirm</div>

<div class="i0">He twists just like a serpent; he’s cunning as a fox;</div>

<div class="i0">He’s slippery as an oyster; he’s fleeter than a deer;</div>

<div class="i0">A terrible, fearfully mixed-up noise,</div>
<div class="i0">Fifty times worse than the college boys,</div>

<div class="i0">Awakened all trembling upon the ground.</div>
<div class="i0">So ended his dream of a college fine,</div>
<div class="i0">With parrots leading the cheering line.</div>
<div class="i0">He looked at his keeper as if to say:</div>
<div class="i0">“I’ll never again eat a bale of hay;</div>
<div class="i0">For such overeating most always means</div>
<div class="i0">The most impossible kind of dreams.</div>
<div class="i0">Come take we a walk, good old Keeper Jack,</div>

<div class="i0">With the kiddies, dear old Keeper, I say,</div>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
